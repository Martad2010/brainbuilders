                If Martad fails to insist upon strict performance of any of your
                obligations or if we fail to exercise any of the rights or
                remedies to which we are entitled, this shall not constitute a
                waiver of such rights or remedies and shall not relieve you from
                compliance with such obligations. A waiver by us of any default
                shall not constitute a waiver of subsequent default. No waiver
                by Martad shall be effective unless provided in writing,
                excluding email.
